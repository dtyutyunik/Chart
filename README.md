# Financial Calculator

## Descripition 

Budgeting and breaking down your expenses can be boring and tiresome, but implementing visuals is a lot of fun. So I implemented a line graph to break down each of your individual expense, as well as a pie chart to show you live breakdown of your savings vs expenses. The best part is that if you make a mistake when entering your numbers, you can simply delete it and my app instantly recalculates it for you.

## Technology
